This project is to implement the standard builtin functionalities of a command shell in Python. This is part of a coding challenge for codecrafters.io. In this project I have implemented the following:
1. Implementing a shell prompt($) and waiting for user input.
2. Printing basic prompts using the echo command.
3. Handling invalid commands and printing exception messages in the terminal
4. Implementing a REPL(Read-Eval-Print Loop) function.
5. Implementing exit 0 command which terminates the process with code/status 0.
6. Implementing the type built in command for the shell.
7. Extending the type built in command to search for executables files using PATH
8. Implementing execution of external programs which are located using the PATH environment variable.
9. Implementing the pwd built in command for printing the working directory using the os module in Python.
10. Implementing the cd built in command for handling the absoulte paths.
11. Extending the cd built in command for handling the relative paths.
12. Extending the cd built in command for handling the '~' Home directory.
    Planning to extend this project for support quoting the single quotes, double quuotes, backslash outside quotes, backslash within single quotes, backslash within double quotes and executing a quuoted executable.
